# 0.7.0
## Bug fixes:
- Switch to `is` instead of `==` to improve static initialization behavior (#130). Thanks @kyay10!
- Ensure objects are not duplicated in the sealed enum list, if reachable from more than one subclass (#135). Thanks @kyay10! 

## Breaking changes:
- The type of `EnumForSealedEnumProvider.enumClass` is updated from a `Class` to a `KClass`.
  This allows `runtime` to not depend on any JVM classes, and therefore can be a multiplatform artifact in the future.

# 0.6.0
## Features:
- Update to Kotlin 1.8

## Miscellaneous updates:
- Various dependency updates
- Updated JDK versions on CI to 1.8, 11 and 17

# 0.5.0
## Features:
- Update to Kotlin 1.7

## Breaking changes:
- The implicit order of sealed subclasses was changed in Kotlin 1.7, resulting in different ordinal orders when using `sealed-enum` `0.4.0` and below.
  `sealed-enum` `0.5.0` restored the expected behavior when declaring subclasses as nested inner classes and defined a deterministic order when subclasses occur elsewhere in the file and package. 

## Miscellaneous updates:
- Various dependency updates
- Switch to using version catalogs and convention plugins

# 0.4.0
## Features:
- Added full support for `sealed interface`s
- Added [KSP](https://github.com/google/ksp) processor as an alternate code generation method 

## Miscellaneous updates:
- Update to Kotlin 1.5
- Add binary compatibility validator
- Added JDK 15 to CI tests
- Added CI to run on macOS and Windows
- Various dependency updates

# 0.3.0
## Breaking changes:
- Artifact ids were updated (`sealedenum` -> `runtime` and `sealedenumprocessor` -> `processor`).
  This was done to accommodate alternate generation implementations, such as by [KSP](https://github.com/google/ksp)

## Miscellaneous updates:
- Switch to GitHub actions for CI
- Various dependency updates

# 0.2.0
## Features:
- Added extension properties and methods to make `sealed-enum` easier to use in common cases.
  In particular, access to `values`, ordinals, names and the `SealedEnum` implementation can all be achieved without having to use a generated class name.
- Added support for isomorphic enum generation via the `generateEnum` argument for `@GenSealedEnum`.
  Isomorphism and class information can be retrieved from the implemented `EnumForSealedEnumProvider` interface.

## Breaking changes:
- `@GenSealedEnum` must now be applied to the companion object of `sealed class`, rather than the `sealed class` itself.
- Processor option for auto-generation without `@GenSealedEnum` was removed.

## Miscellaneous updates:
- Updated to Kotlin 1.4
- Switched to [`kotlin-compile-testing`](https://github.com/tschuchortdev/kotlin-compile-testing) for testing
- Updated dependencies and created `buildSrc` for version management
- Generated code is explicit-api-mode compatible by default (courtesy of KotlinPoet 1.7.x)
